To create a chapter in your Salesforce Commerce Cloud course that guides students through the task of displaying a section on the Product Detail Page (PDP) that lists four suggested products based on the current product's brand, follow this structured approach:

### Chapter: Displaying Suggested Products on the PDP

#### 1. **Introduction**
   - **Objective:** By the end of this chapter, students will be able to implement a feature on the PDP that displays four suggested products based on the brand of the current product.
   - **Prerequisites:** Basic knowledge of Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC), familiarity with the Product Detail Page structure, and understanding of ISML templates and controllers in SFCC.

#### 2. **Understanding the Problem**
   - **Scenario:** The task is to enhance the PDP by adding a section that dynamically lists four suggested products. These suggestions should be filtered based on the brand of the currently viewed product.
   - **Expected Outcome:** A new section on the PDP will display up to four products from the same brand as the current product.

#### 3. **Step-by-Step Implementation Guide**

   ##### Step 1: **Retrieve the Brand of the Current Product**
   - **Task:** Fetch the brand attribute from the current product displayed on the PDP.
   - **Guide:**
     - Access the current product using the `ProductMgr.getProduct()` method.
     - Extract the brand attribute using the `product.custom.brand` (or the appropriate attribute based on the site configuration).
   - **Hint:** Check if the brand attribute is available in the custom attributes or core attributes of the product.

   ##### Step 2: **Fetch Suggested Products**
   - **Task:** Use the brand value to retrieve a list of products that match the brand.
   - **Guide:**
     - Use `ProductSearchModel` to search for products that match the brand.
     - Limit the search results to four products.
     - Ensure the products retrieved are active and available in the catalog.
   - **Sample Code:**
     ```javascript
     var ProductSearchModel = require('dw/catalog/ProductSearchModel');
     var searchModel = new ProductSearchModel();
     searchModel.setSearchPhrase(currentProduct.brand);
     searchModel.search();
     var suggestedProducts = searchModel.getProductSearchHits().asList().slice(0, 4);
     ```
   - **Hint:** Be mindful of performance. Avoid large searches and ensure that only necessary fields are fetched.

   ##### Step 3: **Display the Suggested Products in the ISML Template**
   - **Task:** Update the PDP ISML template to include a section that displays the suggested products.
   - **Guide:**
     - Create a new ISML template (e.g., `suggestedProducts.isml`) to handle the display of the products.
     - Loop through the list of suggested products and render each productâ€™s name, image, and price.
     - Include this template in the main PDP ISML template using the `isinclude` directive.
   - **Sample ISML:**
     ```isml
     <isloop items="${suggestedProducts}" var="product">
         <div class="suggested-product">
             <img src="${product.getImage('small').URL}" alt="${product.name}" />
             <a href="${product.getURL()}">${product.name}</a>
             <span>${product.price}</span>
         </div>
     </isloop>
     ```
   - **Hint:** Style the suggested products section to match the overall design of the PDP.

   ##### Step 4: **Handle Edge Cases**
   - **Task:** Ensure the feature works correctly even when there are fewer than four suggested products or none at all.
   - **Guide:**
     - Add a condition to check if there are fewer than four suggested products and handle the display accordingly.
     - Consider adding a fallback message or alternative suggestions if no matching products are found.
   - **Sample ISML Condition:**
     ```isml
     <isif condition="${suggestedProducts.length > 0}">
         <div class="suggested-products-section">
             <h3>Suggested Products</h3>
             <isinclude template="suggestedProducts.isml" />
         </div>
     <iselse>
         <div>No suggested products available.</div>
     </isif>
     ```

#### 4. **Testing the Implementation**
   - **Task:** Ensure the suggested products section works across different products and brands.
   - **Guide:**
     - Test with products that have well-defined brands and those that do not.
     - Verify that the correct products are suggested based on the current product's brand.
     - Check the display on different devices to ensure responsiveness.

#### 5. **Best Practices and Optimization**
   - **Performance Considerations:**
     - Limit the number of product attributes fetched to improve performance.
     - Use caching mechanisms where appropriate to reduce database load.
   - **User Experience:**
     - Ensure the suggested products are relevant and enhance the shopping experience.
     - Consider adding analytics to track the effectiveness of the suggestions.

#### 6. **Summary**
   - **Recap:** This chapter guided you through the process of adding a brand-based suggested products section to the PDP. You learned how to retrieve product data, filter by brand, and render this dynamically on the page.

#### 7. **Exercise for Students**
   - **Task:** Extend the suggested products feature to include products from related categories if fewer than four products are found for the brand. Provide the steps they should follow and encourage them to consider performance and user experience.

By following this structure, you provide a clear and comprehensive guide for your students, helping them to understand the process and apply their knowledge effectively.
