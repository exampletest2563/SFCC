<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Controllers are server-side scripts written in JavaScript and Salesforce B2C Commerce Script that handle storefront requests. They manage the flow of data in your application, create ViewModels to process each storefront request as a route, and generate an appropriate response.</p>

<p>For example, in a storefront application, clicking a category menu item or entering a search term triggers the controller that renders the page.</p>

<p>Controllers can be broken down into smaller pieces, making it easier to analyze each part individually and understand its responsibilities. We will use the <code>Cart.js</code> controller, located at <code>app_storefront_base/cartridge/controllers/Cart.js</code>, as a reference for this module.</p>
