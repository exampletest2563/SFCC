<p>To view our controller calls (backend functions) rather than just categories, we need to enable something called Storefront URLs. To do this, follow these steps:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Site → RefArch → Site Preferences → Storefront URLs</strong>.</li>
    <li>Uncheck the <strong>Enable Storefront URLs</strong> option.</li>
</ul>
