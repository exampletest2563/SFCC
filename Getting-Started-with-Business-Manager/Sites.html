<p>Your instance might have multiple sites. You can have different sites to offer various brands in different countries.</p>

<p>When you first log into Business Manager for a given instance, no storefront (site) is deployed by default. You must either:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Create a new empty site (which contains no data).</li>
    <li>Import an existing site, such as Storefront Reference Architecture (RefArch) or SiteGenesis.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commerce Cloud includes RefArch and SiteGenesis sample reference sites, which you can use as the basis for your custom Commerce Cloud Digital sites. Both are full-featured demonstration eCommerce sites that you can use to explore the Digital platform and its capabilities. They serve as resources for both developers and merchants:</p>

<ul>
    <li>For developers, they provide sample code scripts and ISML templates.</li>
    <li>For merchants, they offer sample configurations for catalogs, categories, products, and more.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>üìù Exercise: Import RefArch into Your Sandbox</strong></p>

<ol>
    <li>Log in to Business Manager.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Administration ‚Üí Site Development ‚Üí Site Import & Export</strong>.</li>
    <li>Determine whether you want to import the site from a local or a remote instance and select the corresponding radio button.</li>
    <li>Select the <strong>Storefront Reference Architecture Demo Sites</strong> radio button and click <strong>Import</strong>.</li>
    <li>You will be redirected to a new screen with two options. Select the one labeled <strong>Storefront Reference Architecture base</strong>.</li>
    <li>At the bottom right corner, click <strong>Deploy</strong>.</li>
    <li>The page will reload. You should see a red confirmation message. Click the <strong>OK</strong> button on its right side.</li>
    <li>You can view the status of the import in the <strong>Status</strong> section of the page.</li>
    <li>Wait at least 10 minutes and click the <strong>Refresh</strong> button under the Status section. Once the status changes to <strong>Completed</strong>, your site will be ready to use and listed under the sites, right beside the Salesforce logo at the top left corner.</li>
    <li>You will also receive an email notifying you that the job has completed.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is recommended that you import the Reference Storefront Architecture site (RefArch) into an empty sandbox before importing your custom sites. This prevents you from overwriting existing attributes and data for the custom site.</p>

<p>After importing RefArch, you can validate its behavior by comparing it to the site running on the demo instance at <a href="https://production-sitegenesis-dw.demandware.net/s/RefArch/home" target="_blank">https://production-sitegenesis-dw.demandware.net/s/RefArch/home</a>.</p>

<p><strong>üìù Exercise: Create an Empty Site</strong></p>

<p>Although you won't be doing this in practice, let's see how to create an empty site:</p>

<ol>
    <li>In Business Manager, select <strong>Administration > Sites > Manage Sites</strong>.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>New</strong>.</li>
    <li>Enter the site ID, <strong>"SFRATraining"</strong>. The ID is required and should not include spaces.</li>
    <li>Enter the Name, <strong>"SFRATraining"</strong>. The Name is required and can be any text string.</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Currency</strong> drop-down and select your default currency (usually USD Dollar). You can only have one default currency per site. This is a required field.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
    <li>Now, you can view or configure your new site:
        <ul>
            <li>To select the site, click the site name, <strong>SFRATraining</strong>, located on the site list.</li>
            <li>Select <strong>Site ‚Üí Storefront</strong>. A browser window will open, displaying the storefront URL.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>
