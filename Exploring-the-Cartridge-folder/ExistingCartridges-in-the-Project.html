<h2>Existing Cartridges in the Project</h2>

<p>As you might have noticed, our project includes only three cartridges. Let's examine them briefly to understand what is important right now and what can be addressed later as needed:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>app_storefront_base:</strong> This is the most crucial folder. It contains the entire storefront reference code.</li>
    <li><strong>bm_app_storefront_base:</strong> This is an optional Business Manager cartridge used to add Page Designer functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>modules:</strong> The modules folder is a peer of the cartridge folders. Commerce Cloud provides it for globally shared modules, such as third-party modules.</li>
</ul>
