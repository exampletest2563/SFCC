<h2>Site Path on Business Manager</h2>

<p>When we refer to a "path," consider it as a form field listing all cartridges used in the project, separated by a colon. Each site has its own path.</p>

<p>Uploading your code to the Sandbox is a mandatory step for your code to function on your storefront, but it is not the only requirement. To ensure a site uses a cartridge, you must add the cartridge to the site's path in Business Manager.</p>

<p>To do this:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Open Business Manager.</li>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Administration > Sites > Manage Sites > RefArch > Settings Tab</strong>.</li>
    <li>Locate the <strong>Cartridges</strong> field. This field represents the path we discussed.</li>
    <li>Add the new cartridge to the cartridge path, positioning it before the <code>app_storefront_base</code> cartridge. (Remember, if there are duplicate files in different cartridges, the first one found, based on the order in the Cartridges field, will be used.)</li>
    <li>Ensure that site caching is disabled for the site.</li>
</ol>
