<h2>Exploring the app_storefront_base Cartridge</h2>

<h3>Never Modify This Cartridge</h3>

<p>As mentioned before, the <code>app_storefront_base</code> cartridge is the most important of all cartridges because it contains all the reference SFRA base code and functionality. Remember, you should never modify anything inside this cartridge.</p>

<p>You might be wondering why it is crucial to avoid altering this cartridge. Imagine that this cartridge serves as a reference for all other cartridges. For example, if you have two custom cartridges that depend on a certain file within <code>app_storefront_base</code>:</p>

<p>If you modify the file inside <code>app_storefront_base</code>, the changes will affect all cartridges that reference it. Suppose one custom cartridge expects these changes and works fine, but the second custom cartridge does not expect the change. This modification could cause unexpected behavior in the second cartridge, potentially breaking functionality and negatively impacting the client’s site.</p>

<h3>Understanding Each Folder</h3>

<p>Each cartridge is contained within a single directory and has specific sub-directories where certain file types should be stored. Here's an overview of each folder and its purpose:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>client:</strong> Contains all client-side code, including frontend JavaScript and SCSS. This is where frontend developers will spend most of their time, along with the templates folder.</li>
    <li><strong>config:</strong> Contains configuration files. Typically, you will not need to modify this folder's content.</li>
    <li><strong>controllers:</strong> Contains all the endpoints with their respective logic used by your storefront site. This is where backend developers will spend most of their time.</li>
    <li><strong>experience:</strong> Contains definition files used by the Page Designer tool. Page Designer is not covered in this course.</li>
    <li><strong>forms:</strong> Contains all form definition files used for data validation and field definitions. Form definitions are usually created in this folder.</li>
    <li><strong>models:</strong> Contains object definitions used to pass data within your storefront site pages and retrieve object data from the sandbox. Models are heavily used inside controllers, making it important for backend developers to understand them for customization.</li>
    <li><strong>pipelines:</strong> Contains all the legacy backend logic used by your storefront site. Pipelines are represented graphically in XML files, which are rarely touched when working with SFRA. Additional training will be provided if needed.</li>
    <li><strong>scripts:</strong> Contains all helper scripts used by controllers, models, other scripts, and even templates. Salesforce B2C Commerce provides a proprietary scripting language, DWScript, which is interpreted by the server and included in storefront pages as JavaScript.</li>
    <li><strong>static:</strong> Contains all static files generated by Webpack’s bundling process, such as branding images. These files are unlikely to change, so avoid modifying them.</li>
    <li><strong>templates:</strong> Contains template files and resource bundle files (.properties extension). Resource bundles make it possible for labels and other texts in the storefront site to be displayed in multiple languages. Frontend developers will spend significant time here, along with the client folder.</li>
</ul>
