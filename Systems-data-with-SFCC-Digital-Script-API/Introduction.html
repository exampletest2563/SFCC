<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>All <code>require</code> statements in previous chapters of the SFRA course that start with <code>dw/</code> are part of the Salesforce Commerce Cloud API. We do not have access to their source code. For details, functions, and attributes related to these modules, refer to the official documentation.</p>

<p>We use these modules to access data about the system, such as products, catalogs, prices, etc. You can access the API from both controllers and ISML templates, including within <code>&lt;isscript&gt;</code> tags.</p>
