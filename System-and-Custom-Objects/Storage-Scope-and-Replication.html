<h2>Storage Scope and Replication</h2>

<p>One aspect we did not discuss in the System Objects section was Scope, as it was not necessary at that point. However, it is important to understand now.</p>

<p>Scope refers to the visibility of the objectâ€”who or what can see and use it. There are two options:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Organization</strong>: The Custom Object is visible to all storefronts within the organization.</li>
    <li><strong>Site</strong>: The Custom Object is visible only to a specific storefront (Site) in your sandbox.</li>
</ul>

<p>Whether a Custom Object should be visible to all storefronts or just a specific one depends on your project requirements.</p>

<p>The Custom Object type itself is always available to the entire organization. Additionally, you can specify if you want Custom Object instances to be replicable.</p>
