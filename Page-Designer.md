Here are several ideas for SFCC (Salesforce Commerce Cloud) back-end exercises that involve the Page Designer module:

### 1. **Custom Component Development**
   - **Exercise:** Create a custom Page Designer component that allows for dynamic rendering of product information based on the category selected by the merchant.
   - **Focus:** Learn how to create custom components and integrate them with SFCC data models (e.g., Product and Category models).

### 2. **Component-Based Promotions**
   - **Exercise:** Develop a Page Designer component that automatically applies a promotion banner to a product or category page based on current promotions set in the Business Manager.
   - **Focus:** Practice integrating promotion rules with front-end display components and conditional rendering.

### 3. **Personalized Content Rendering**
   - **Exercise:** Build a component that displays personalized content (e.g., recommendations, discounts) based on user segments or customer groups.
   - **Focus:** Explore SFCC's customer group and segmentation features, and how they can be used to personalize content on the storefront.

### 4. **Dynamic Content Management**
   - **Exercise:** Create a component that pulls and displays dynamic content from an external CMS or API, such as a blog feed or social media posts.
   - **Focus:** Work with SFCC’s content management features and external data integration.

### 5. **A/B Testing with Page Designer**
   - **Exercise:** Set up A/B testing on different Page Designer layouts or components to analyze user behavior and determine which design performs better.
   - **Focus:** Gain hands-on experience with SFCC’s A/B testing capabilities and learn how to implement and analyze tests.

### 6. **Localized Content Management**
   - **Exercise:** Build components that allow merchants to easily create and manage localized content for different regions or languages.
   - **Focus:** Leverage SFCC’s localization features, such as translations and regional content management.

### 7. **Custom Layout Configuration**
   - **Exercise:** Create multiple custom layouts within Page Designer for different types of pages (e.g., landing pages, product detail pages) and assign specific components to each layout.
   - **Focus:** Practice creating and managing custom layouts and configuring component behaviors.

### 8. **SEO Optimization Component**
   - **Exercise:** Develop a component that allows the merchant to easily manage meta tags, structured data, and other SEO-related content directly from the Page Designer interface.
   - **Focus:** Enhance skills in optimizing SFCC pages for search engines using custom components.

### 9. **Event-Driven Content Updates**
   - **Exercise:** Implement a component that updates content automatically based on specific events (e.g., product launch, sales event), triggered by a custom job or external service.
   - **Focus:** Learn to connect Page Designer components with scheduled jobs or external triggers.

### 10. **Analytics and Tracking Integration**
   - **Exercise:** Create a component that integrates with analytics tools (e.g., Google Analytics, Adobe Analytics) to track user interactions with Page Designer components.
   - **Focus:** Enhance understanding of analytics tracking and data collection through custom component development.

### 11. **Advanced Slot Configuration**
   - **Exercise:** Set up and configure advanced slot types in Page Designer that can dynamically pull in different types of content based on the page type, user role, or other conditions.
   - **Focus:** Deepen understanding of slot management and dynamic content rendering.

### 12. **Form Handling and Data Submission**
   - **Exercise:** Create a custom form component within Page Designer that allows users to submit data, which is then processed and stored using SFCC’s backend services.
   - **Focus:** Practice building form-handling logic and connecting it with SFCC’s backend services.

These exercises should provide a solid foundation in working with Page Designer in Salesforce Commerce Cloud, covering various aspects from component development to content management, and backend integrations.



### Problem Description: Custom Component Development

**Objective:**  
Your task is to develop a custom Page Designer component that enables merchants to dynamically display product information based on the selected category within Salesforce Commerce Cloud (SFCC). This component should be versatile, allowing the merchant to easily configure and manage which category's products are displayed on a given page using the Page Designer interface.

**Requirements:**

1. **Component Creation:**
   - Develop a custom Page Designer component named "Category Product Display."
   - The component should allow the merchant to select a product category from a dropdown list within the Page Designer configuration panel.

2. **Dynamic Product Rendering:**
   - Upon selecting a category, the component should dynamically render a list of products from that category on the page.
   - The product information displayed should include the product name, price, image, and a "View Product" button that links to the product detail page.

3. **Pagination and Limits:**
   - Implement a configuration option within the component to limit the number of products displayed. The merchant should be able to choose how many products are shown per page (e.g., 4, 8, 12).
   - If the selected category contains more products than the limit, implement pagination within the component to allow users to navigate through the products.

4. **Customization Options:**
   - Provide options for the merchant to customize the display, such as the number of products per row (e.g., 2, 3, 4) and whether or not to show product descriptions.
   - Allow for the selection of a specific sorting method (e.g., by price, by name, by newest) for the displayed products.

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error handling to manage scenarios where the selected category does not contain any products or if the category is invalid.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Provide clear instructions on how to use the component, including how to add it to a page, configure it, and any dependencies or limitations.

**Deliverables:**
- A fully functional "Category Product Display" component that meets the requirements outlined above.
- A brief guide on how to add, configure, and use the component within Page Designer.
- Source code with appropriate comments and documentation explaining key parts of the implementation.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Correctness and completeness of the component functionality.
- Usability and flexibility of the component for merchants.
- Quality of code, including structure, readability, and documentation.
- Proper handling of edge cases and errors.

This exercise will help you understand the process of creating custom components in SFCC and integrating them with the platform's data models, as well as providing an opportunity to enhance your skills in developing flexible, merchant-friendly features in Page Designer.
