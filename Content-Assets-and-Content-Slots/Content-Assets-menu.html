<h3>Content Assets Menu</h3>

<p>To locate Content Assets, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to the <strong>Merchant Tools</strong> menu.</li>
    <li>Navigate to <strong>Content > Content Assets</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you click on <strong>Content Assets</strong>, the Content Assets management page will be displayed.</p>

<p>It's important to note the following detail at the top of the page: <strong>Merchant Tools > Content > Libraries > RefArchSharedLibrary > Content</strong>.</p>

<p>So, where does this <em>RefArchSharedLibrary</em> come from? It is the name of the metadata file that contains the definitions and data for all content assets in your RefArchGlobal site.</p>
<h3>Content Assets Structure</h3>

<p>To explore the information stored in a content asset, such as the <strong>about-us</strong> asset, follow these steps:</p>

<p>When you open a Content Asset, you'll first notice a warning at the top:</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>You havenâ€™t locked this content for editing. Click <strong>Lock</strong> if you need to edit the content. You have seen this same warning when working with products, right? To edit the content, make sure to click on <strong>Lock</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Next, check the fields being displayed:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Fields like <strong>Online</strong> and <strong>Searchable</strong> typically have the value <strong>Default</strong>, which means this setting is applied to every site. However, you also have the option to apply different behaviors to different sites.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means you or the merchant can create content that can be used across multiple sites with different behaviors without duplicating the content.</p>
