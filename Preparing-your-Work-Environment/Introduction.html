<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Now that weâ€™ve covered the basics with Business Manager, it's time to examine our programming environment. Officially, Salesforce used Eclipse with a plugin called UXStudio for SFCC platform development (now deprecated, it is used for legacy code in SiteGenesis and Pipelines). However, with the release of SFRA, Salesforce has developed a Node.js package that handles code changes and uploads them to the sandbox, allowing us to work with any IDE of our choice.</p>

<p>Additionally, there is an SFCC extension developed for Visual Studio Code called Prophet. This extension performs the same functions as the Node.js package but provides menu options instead of requiring terminal commands.</p>

<p>The recommended IDE for developing with SFRA is Visual Studio Code. During this course, we will use it along with the Prophet extension.</p>

<p>To work with SFRA, you will need to install Node.js version 10.x or higher.</p>
