<h2>Your Functions Should Do One Thing</h2>

<p>You’ve probably heard this advice before: functions should focus on doing one thing. While there is much debate about what precisely constitutes "one thing," the general principle remains important.</p>

<p>For instance, if adding a product to the cart involves writing 100 lines of code to handle validations, retrieve necessary data, and perform other tasks, should all these tasks be included in a single function? The answer lies in the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), introduced by Robert C. Martin. According to SRP, every module, class, or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program’s functionality, and it should encapsulate that part. All services provided by that module, class, or function should be closely aligned with its core responsibility.</p>
