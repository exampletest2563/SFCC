<h2>Managing Variation Masters and Variation Products</h2>

<p>Use variation masters to display a product in the product listing page, and variation products are the SKUs with specific variations (like size and color) that customers purchase:</p>

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Variation Master</th>
            <th>Variation Products</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Has no values for the varying attributes (like color, size)</td>
            <td>Have values for the varying attributes (like color, size)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Has no SKU, and cannot be bought by the customer</td>
            <td>Have a SKU and can be bought by a customer with a price</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Determines the attributes</td>
            <td>Inherit their attributes</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Attaching Variation Products to a Variation Master</h3>

<p>Most systems import products with the variation products already assigned to a variation master. Some systems require that you create the variation master then attach the variation products to it. To attach a variation product to a variation master:</p>

<ol>
    <li>If it doesn‚Äôt exist already, create a variation master.</li>
    <li>Lock it.</li>
    <li>Select the <strong>Variations</strong> tab.</li>
    <li>Scroll to the <strong>New Variation Product</strong> section.</li>
    <li>Select the variation product to add to the variation master.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Add</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Selecting a Default Variation Product</h3>

<p>Select one of the variation products as the default by clicking on the variation and selecting the radio button. That variation displays in the search results and on the product detail page.</p>

<h2>Product Sets</h2>

<p>A product set is a group of related products presented together. It is sometimes known as a Merchandizing Set, Retail Set, or Promotion Set. You can display product sets in a category to create a ‚Äúlook book‚Äù with images that display how the products are related to each other.</p>

<p>For example, a product set could contain a sweater, pants, and shoes. Customers can purchase each product separately.</p>

<p>A product set:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Contains multiple products that customers can purchase individually.</li>
    <li>Each product in the set has its own individual SKU and price.</li>
    <li>Is not a product itself ‚Äì the set cannot be ordered and does not have a price.</li>
    <li>Can have its own display attributes such as name, images, and merchandising links to other products or product sets.</li>
    <li>Has a primary category assignment ‚Äì if a Product Set is in multiple categories, this assignment enables you to identify which category should result from a successful search for this product set.</li>
</ul>

<h3>To Create a Product Set:</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Merchant Tools ‚Üí Products & Catalogs ‚Üí Product Sets</strong>.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>New</strong>.</li>
    <li>Fill in the required fields.</li>

<h3>üìù Exercise: Create a Product Set</h3>

<ol>

    <li>Create a product set.</li>
    <li>Place it into your category.</li>
</ol>
