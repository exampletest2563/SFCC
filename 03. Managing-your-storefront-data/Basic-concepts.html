<h2>Basic Concepts</h2>

<p>To understand what you can and cannot do with your storefront, letâ€™s review some basic concepts:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Products:</strong> A product is anything that you can sell on your website.</li>
    <li><strong>Categories:</strong> Categories organize the structure of products on a storefront. A catalog contains a category tree, which is a hierarchy of nested categories. This category tree drives the storefront navigation, enabling customers to browse from one grouping of products to the next. This structure makes it easier to find products quickly.</li>
    <li><strong>Catalogs:</strong> Catalogs are flexible and extensible frameworks that:
        <ul>
            <li>Act as a container for products, categories, and images.</li>
            <li>Support multi-site, multi-brand, and multi-language implementations.</li>
            <li>Provide access to business attribute definitions.</li>
            <li>Are assigned to a storefront to provide a structure for navigation and search.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
