<h2>Editing a Product</h2>

<p>Search for the product that you would like to edit and click the product’s ID or name link.</p>

<h3>Locking Products</h3>
<p>Locking a product gives a Business Manager user exclusive access to edit that product and its variations. By default, the lock expires in an hour. The user must lock the product before submitting changes via the <strong>Apply</strong> button.</p>

<h3>Set a Product Offline</h3>
<p>If there is any reason that a product is not ready to be sold, you should take it offline. To take a product offline:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Search for the product that you would like to change.</li>
    <li>Click on the <strong>Variations</strong> tab and click on the master of the product.</li>
    <li>Lock the product.</li>
    <li>Set <strong>Online</strong> to <strong>No</strong>.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Delete vs. Offline vs. Unassign</h3>
<p>Deleting a product removes it completely, while setting it to offline only removes it from the storefront but does not remove it from the catalog. However, removing the assignment of a product to a category removes the product from being displayed in that category on the storefront. For example, if a product is in both the Men’s category and the Sale category, you can unassign it from the Sale category while still keeping it in the Men’s category.</p>

<p>To delete a product:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Merchant Tools → Products and Catalogs → Products</strong>.</li>
    <li>Select the product using the checkbox on the left.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Delete</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Business Manager prompts you to confirm the deletion. Click <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>

<h3>Choosing a Category While Editing a Product</h3>
<p>When assigning a product to one or more categories, use the <strong>Categories</strong> tab to identify the classification and the primary categories:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The <strong>Classification</strong> category defines the attribute set of the product.</li>
    <li>The <strong>Primary</strong> category defines which category a product should appear in when accessed via search. It does not affect the category navigation hierarchy (the “home” of the product).</li>
</ul>

<p>You could assign a new product to multiple categories (such as New Arrivals, Sale, Kids Shoes). The classification category would be Kids Shoes providing shoe attributes, while the Sale category would be the primary category for people who search.</p>

<p>To change a category while editing a product:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Edit the product.</li>
    <li>Click <strong>Edit Categories</strong> to assign the product to a certain category.</li>
</ol>
