<h2>Catalogs</h2>

<p>There are two types of catalogs: the master catalog and the storefront catalog. Each storefront site needs to have one and only one storefront catalog assigned to it, which drives the navigation of the storefront.</p>

<p>Although this example uses only one catalog, it is possible to work with several catalogs at once by using a master catalog. Master catalogs contain the productsâ€™ data. A product that is owned by a master catalog can also be assigned to a storefront catalog so that it will display online.</p>

<p>You can share a master catalog between several sites. A set of products from a master catalog can be assigned to one storefront catalog, while a different set from the same master catalog can be assigned to another storefront catalog.</p>

<p>In this way, you can present different products to customers in two different countries while still managing the products centrally in one catalog.</p>

<p>The categories in a master catalog can be completely different from those in the storefront catalog. In fact, category trees cannot be shared among catalogs.</p>

<p>To determine if a catalog is a storefront or a master catalog, click on it or on the <strong>Edit</strong> link related to it. On the Catalog Edit page, the first section will indicate what kind of catalog it is.</p>
