<h2>Categories</h2>

<p>When you begin your storefront site implementation, you will identify the structure and hierarchy for your categories. Categories and products are frequently imported from a legacy system.</p>

<p>Access categories through their respective catalogs. To edit categories in Business Manager:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Merchant Tools → Products and Catalogs → Catalogs → {select a catalog}</strong>.</li>
    <li>Click the <strong>Edit</strong> button for a category.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following screen will display:</p>

<p>It contains the following tabs:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>General Tab:</strong> This tab identifies the general attributes for the category (for example, category ID, name, description, online status, and online dates).</li>
    <li><strong>Select Language (Locale):</strong> Selecting a language enables you to enter text for that language. For instance, if you enter French text, customers must switch their storefront language to French to view that text. This feature is used in categories, products, and elsewhere in Business Manager.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> If your site supports both English and French, you would enter the category name “Men” in English and then switch to enter “Homme” in French.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Category Attributes Tab:</strong> This tab enables you to specify Search Engine Optimization, Sitemap Attributes, Presentation Attributes, Search Ranking, and other custom attributes.</li>
    <li><strong>Product Attribute Definition Tab:</strong> This list shows attribute groups attached to this category. Category attribute groups define product attributes for all products bound to this category. Provide an ID and click <strong>Add</strong> to add a new attribute group to the category.</li>
    <li><strong>Search Refinement Definitions Tab:</strong> This tab identifies the search refinements for each category. This allows customers to refine a search using multiple attributes, such as price, category, or product attributes. This reduces the quantity of products displayed on the storefront.
        <ul>
            <li>Customers may use search refinements to find TVs based on screen size, price, and manufacturer. This is particularly useful for filtering a large catalog when a customer is looking for very specific products.</li>
            <li>Customers may use search refinements to reduce the quantity of products displayed so that only women’s shoes in size 4 ½ are shown on the storefront.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Page Meta Tag Rules:</strong> This tab shows the rules applied for the current category to display meta tag values such as name, description, robots, title, and so on.</li>
    <li><strong>Categorization Rules:</strong> This tab allows you to define rules to add products to this category.</li>
    <li><strong>Magnifying Glass Icon:</strong> This icon enables you to preview the category on the Storefront.</li>
</ul>
