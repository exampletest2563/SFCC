<h2>Defining Product Attributes</h2>

<p>Some clients have hundreds of product attributes. These attributes can be defined at different levels, and products inherit attributes from the catalog but can have these overridden at various levels.</p>

<p>To view product attribute definitions by category:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Go to <strong>Products and Catalogs → {catalog} → {category} → Product Attributes Definition tab</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Usually, you define the most generic attributes at the catalog level and specify more detailed attributes at the category level.</p>
