<h2>Products</h2>

<p>Although you can create products in Commerce Cloud, products and product attribute data are often imported into the platform on a schedule. This import can be done automatically from a feed that is scheduled to take place overnight. Once imported, you can view or modify the products as needed to enhance the customer experience. For example, you can:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Add products (i.e., create product sets)</li>
    <li>Update product descriptions</li>
    <li>Add images</li>
    <li>Tune Search Engine Optimization (SEO) attributes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Searching for Products</h3>

<p>There are multiple methods to search for products in Business Manager:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Simple Search:</strong> When you know the product name, part of the product name, the ID, or part of the ID. Leaving it blank will return all products.</li>
    <li><strong>By ID Search:</strong> Can find multiple products by ID. IDs can be pasted into this field as a list separated by commas, spaces/tabs, or newlines.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced Search:</strong> To narrow results by attributes, catalog, status, and/or product type. The asterisk (*) can be used as a wildcard.
        <ul>
            <li>Example: <strong>*shirt</strong> will match t-shirt, tee-shirt, and nightshirt.</li>
            <li>Example: <strong>sweat*</strong> will match sweatshirt, sweatpants, and sweater.</li>
            <li>Example: <strong>*ear*</strong> will match clear, earring, etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The search results can be ordered alphabetically and can handle attributes. Additional columns can be added to the list of results for all users. The results list uses the following icons to show status: online/offline, in-stock, searchable, and categorized.</p>
