<h2>Product Bundles</h2>

<p>A bundle is a separate product with its own SKU and price that combines the offerings of multiple products for one price. To view them, go to <strong>Merchant Tools ‚Üí Products and Catalogs ‚Üí Products ‚Üí Advanced Search</strong>.</p>

<p>A bundle can include products of different types: master products with variations, even other bundles. You manage the bundle‚Äôs attributes within the bundle product, while you manage the attributes for the included products within the products themselves.</p>

<p>For example, creating a promotion for the Warhawk game will not change the $449.99 price for the Playstation 3 Bundle. Promotions applied to bundled products do not affect the price of individual products contained within the bundle if purchased separately. Similarly, creating a promotion for the Playstation 3 Bundle will not affect the price of the Warhawk game.</p>

<p>Just like for Product Sets, to check if a single product is part of a set, use the <strong>Bundles</strong> tab inside the product itself.</p>
